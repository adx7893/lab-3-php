## Overview
This project is a multi-step job application form for a recruitment website that I designed using HTML, PHP, sessions, and cookies. The application includes a user authentication system, which requires users to log in before accessing the job application form. Additionally, I utilized cookies to remember user login details for subsequent visits.

- Data validation and sanitization
- Session management to store data across multiple steps
- Final application review and submission
- Confirmation email (simulated) upon submission
